      "First, I need to understand the structure they want. The example provided includes sections like contactInformation, education, workExperience, skills, languages, etc. So, my goal is to map each part of the resume text into these corresponding JSON fields.\n",

      "Starting with contact information: The resume starts with the name \"HAGER NASSER ELHALWANY\". Then it lists the location as \"Elsanta, Tanta, Egypt\", a phone number \"+20 109 067 4213\", and an email \"hager51naser@gmail.com\". The GitHub link isn't explicitly mentioned in contact info but is under projects, so I'll exclude that for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, education: There are two educational entries. The first is a diploma in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning from Information Technology Institute (ITI), Mansoura, Egypt, spanning October 2021 to June 2022. The second is a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Tanta University, October 2017 to August 2021, with a very good grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Work experience: There are two work experiences. The first is as a Junior Freelance Machine Learning Engineer starting May 2022 to present via Upwork. The second is Content Marketing at FoxTech Media from August 2021 to November 2021 in Tanta, Egypt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Projects: The resume lists two projects. The OLSM System was developed from May 2022 to August 2022 using various tools and technologies. The InferMedica Chatbot was built from March 2021 to June 2021 using NLP techniques and Flask APIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Skills section is quite extensive. I'll list each skill separately, ensuring they are in the skills array as individual strings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Languages: The resume mentions Arabic as native and English as very good. So, both should be included.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also notice that the GitHub link is under activities, but since it's a contact point, maybe it should go into contactInformation. However, in the initial example, GitHub isn't part of contact info, so I'll stick to excluding it unless instructed otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, formatting dates: The user wants standardized formats like \"Month Year - Month Year\". For example, October 2021 – June 2022. Similarly, locations should be \"City, Country\".\n",

      "I need to ensure all fields are clear and concise, no extra info. Also, skills and languages should be in correct formats without any additional descriptions.\n",

      "First, I'll look for the section labeled \"EDUCATION\". Scanning through, I see that under \"WORK EXPERIENCE\" there's a mention of \"ITI Diploma in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning\" awarded by the Information Technology Institute in Mansoura, Egypt. The dates are OCT 2021 – JUN 2022.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I need to structure each education entry correctly. Each should include degree, university, start year, end year, and grade where applicable. For the EPITA program, since there's no degree specified, I'll leave that field blank or set it to null if allowed by the JSON schema.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also notice a course mentioned: Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree from Future Work is Digital on Udacity, but this seems more like a professional development course rather than an academic education. It might not be necessary unless the resume explicitly lists it under education, which it doesn't. So I'll focus only on the formal education entries.\n",
